# Micronaut Polymorphic Config Example

This repository provides examples of how to implement polymorphic serialization in the [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) framework. Polymorphic serialization allows handling multiple types of configurations or data objects within a unified structure, making your application more flexible and extensible.

## Overview

The examples in this repository demonstrate:

- Configuring and using polymorphic serialization in Micronaut.
- Managing multiple object types within a shared configuration structure.
- Leveraging Micronaut's features to simplify polymorphism in serialization and deserialization.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following:

- **Java Code**: Examples written in Java to showing  polymorphic serialization classes.
- **Groovy Code**: Spock test writen to show behavior of config classes.
